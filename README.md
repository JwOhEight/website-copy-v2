# website-copy-v2
This is a near-identical copy of TOP's landing page code. I did this to help myself understand how to code the landing page better as I've been struggling with doing it myself.

The major difference between my code and their code:
    
    1. I did not include a :root selector with color variables in my CSS
    2. I did not include spaces between each section of the page in my HTML
    3. I commented HTML and CSS properties, values, tags, and elements that I did not understand at first

I don't claim credit for 99% of the code I have written into my CSS and HTML.
